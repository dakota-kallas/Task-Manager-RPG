Authors: Chase Roehl, Dakota Kallas, and Cailyn Paul

Description: An app that is hybrid between a task manager and a role-playing game. Users will have
their own customizable avatar that they need to keep happy by completing tasks and keeping their
avatar healthy. As tasks are completed, the avatar will earn experience points that can be used to level
up different traits, such as strength, hygiene, mood, health, etc. Strength will be upgraded by
doing exercise tasks such as going to the gym or going for a run. Energy will level up by doing tasks
such as reading and studying. Mood would level up by doing social tasks such as hanging out with
friends. If you ever run out of tasks to complete and want to do something spontaneous just click the
'Bored?' button!

Why: We wanted to create a better way to organize your daily tasks in a fun and fresh way! By
implementing everyday tasks and activities into a simple program in which you can level up your
character, you will be more motivated to work towards completing your goals. We think this could be
helpful for students, parents, or anyone that struggles to accomplish all that they want to do.

Tools needed: Python, Tkinter, GitHub/repl.it (collaboration), Piskel (pixel art editor).
